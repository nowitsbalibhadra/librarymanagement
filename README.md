“Online Library Management System” using OOP's concept
The task is to create an “Online Library Management System”. For this, you have to create a library class which includes the following methods:

Displaybook() : To display the available books
Lendbook(): To lend a book to a user
Addbook(): To add a book in the library
Returnbook(): To return the book in the library.

As you have created a library class, now you will create an object and pass the following parameters in the constructor.

baliLibrary=Library(listofbooks, library_name)

After that, create a main function and run an infinite while loop which asks the users for their input whether they want to display, lend, add or return a book.
